/**
 * Hot-package version arithmetic.
 *
 * A hot package is named `<app>-t<terminal>-sp<n>`: the app version, the
 * sandbox runtime version, and a sequence number that only moves inside one
 * line. Everything here is a pure function of those strings — no Android API,
 * no file system — so the decision the app makes at startup can be tested on a
 * plain JVM (see the checks in the repository's release notes and
 * `scripts/`-adjacent test runs).
 *
 * Why the app needs it at all: the baked overlay is re-applied on every launch,
 * so a package the user fetched or picked would otherwise be silently replaced
 * by the older files the APK carries. {@link #shouldReplay} is the rule that
 * says when that user package still wins.
