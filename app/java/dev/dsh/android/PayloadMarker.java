/**
 * Is the runtime on disk the one this shell should use?
 *
 * The payload carries a `.payload-<version>` marker in the runtime directory, and
 * `Payload.install()` extracts only when {@link App#isBundledReady()} is false. That
 * check used to accept *any* marker, which meant "some runtime exists" — so a shell
 * that ships a newer payload never replaced it:
 *
 *   * an app update kept the old runtime forever (new `pnpm`, new apt packages and
 *     the whole terminal line would never arrive — installing the full APK changed
 *     nothing on a device that already had a runtime);
 *   * a stale file the user had installed by hand (e.g. a `pnpm` symlink) survived
 *     every update, which is how "预装 pnpm" silently failed.
 *
 * A full shell therefore accepts only its own payload's marker. A slim shell carries
 * no payload at all, so whatever runtime is present (downloaded as `t<terminal>` or
 * imported by the user) is the right one — that leniency stays.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no Android types, so the decision table is testable on a JVM
 * (see {@code HotVersion} for the same pattern).
