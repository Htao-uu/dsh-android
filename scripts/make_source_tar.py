"""Pack the source tree into one tarball, without the things that are not source.

What ships: the repository's contents — app/ payload/ plugin/ profile/ patches/
scripts/ docs/ and the version ledgers. What does not:

    lab/        a 543 MB npm tree used to run a second harness for UI work
    build/ out/ generated payloads and APKs (1.4 GB + 181 MB)
    keystore/   the signing identity. It is not in the repository either: losing
                it means never shipping an update to an installed app again, and
                leaking it means anyone can sign updates as this app.

A note inside the archive says all of that, so whoever opens it later is not left
guessing why the tree looks incomplete.

Usage: make_source_tar.py [--root DIR] [--out FILE]

This archive holds the repository's source, not its build outputs:

  lab/        omitted — a 543 MB npm tree used to run a second harness locally
  build/ out/ omitted — generated payloads, APKs and hot packages
  keystore/   omitted on purpose — the app's signing identity. It is not in the
              repository either. Never share it: whoever holds it can sign an
              update that an installed app will accept.

To build, see docs/BUILD.md. The short version:

    sh scripts/build_apk.sh            # full APK
    SLIM=1 sh scripts/build_apk.sh     # shell-only APK

Versioning (three parts), release channels and the list of traps this project has
already hit are in HANDOFF.md and docs/BUILD.md.
