# Fetch the PRoot runtime library the APK embeds (lib/arm64-v8a/libproot.so).
#
# The build machine this project grew up on keeps it at
# /var/minis/mounts/Download/libproot.so, a path a CI runner does not have, and the
# repository deliberately carries no binaries. So the file is published once as a
# release asset and fetched here against a pinned sha256.
#
# PROVENANCE IS UNCONFIRMED: the copy this pins came from that local mount path,
# not from a verified upstream release. Its licence is therefore also unconfirmed
# (PRoot itself is GPL-2.0; this build's exact source has not been checked). See
# THIRD_PARTY.md — do not treat this as a vetted third-party component yet.
#
# Usage: fetch-proot.sh [output-path]   (default build/proot/libproot.so)
